#Requirements

- [] Every script should be related to one platform and interpreter (example: Ubuntu and bash);
- [] Every platform is identified by a Name, Version and Interpreter (Windows, for example, has Powershell, cmd and others. One script made for powershell may not work with cmd.);
- [] Every interpreter should have a different style to exhibit it's text so the user can quick differentiate one from another;
- [] A platform can have multiple interpreters;
- [] A script must have a name and version, a format (ex: sh, bat, ps1, etc.), character encoding and its content per se;
- [] A version is a dot separated list of numbers, which may or may not have multiple digits (20.04, 180.0.3, etc);
- [] The user should be able to see every script in a long list;
- [] This list should be split into pages;
- [] The list should have a button so the user can view each script in its own detail page;
- [] This detail page should show all the data of the script, but the main purpose is to show the script content, which should be selectable and copyable. A button should facilitate the process for selecting and copying the text. Also, a download button should be available, so the user can just download and right click the script to run it on the target machine.
